19.	The length of the side of the cube is contained in the variable a. Write a program that calculates
and displays the volume and surface area of the cube. Sample result:
Cube side: 4
Cube volume: 64
Cube surface area: 96
'''
a = 4
volume = a**3
surface_area = 6*a**2
print(f'Cube side: {a}\nCube volume: {volume}\nCube surface area: {surface_area}')
