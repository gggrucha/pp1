41.	The binary numeral system is a positional numeral system that requires only two digits to write numbers:
0 and 1. The hexadecimal numeral system is a positional numeral system that uses sixteen distinct symbols, 
most often the symbols "0"–"9" to represent values 0 to 9, and "A"–"F" (or alternatively "a"–"f") 
to represent values from ten to fifteen. Both are widely used in mathematics, computer science 
and digital electronics. Write a program that reads an integer number from the keyboard 
and displays that value as a binary and hexadecimal number. 
To convert a decimal number to binary or hexadecimal value, 
use the available Python functions. Sample result:
Enter number: 125
Binary number: 0b1111101
Hexadecimal number: 0x7d
