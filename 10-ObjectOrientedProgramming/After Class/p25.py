25.	A stadium is divided into sectors, each marked with a letter. There is a certain number of fans in each sector. Define the class C, which allows you to create an object representing the stadium with a list of sectors and the number of fans in sectors. Data, as a dictionary, should be transferred to the object at the time of its creation. Define in the class a method m1(s,n) that allows you to change the number of fans n in sector s or add a new sector s with the given number of fans n. Define in the class a method m2(s) that returns the sum of fans in the sectors listed in the string s. Sample result:
C({"A":120,"D":150,"G":90,"K":110})
m1("G",130)
m2("GD") returns 280
m2("KEJ") returns 110
