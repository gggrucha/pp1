'''
30.	In a beverage factory, a machine fills 500ml bottles. 
The computer checks whether the bottle has been filled correctly. 
For a 500ml bottle, the allowable tolerance is 2%. In the last ten bottles checked, the filling was:
508,500,512,499,492,511,503,476,501,509
Write a program that calculates the percentage of incorrectly filled bottles. 
Use the filter() along with a higher order function. Sample result:
Bottle capacity:    500ml
Filling tolerance:  2%
Filled bottles:     508,500,512,499,492,511,503,476,501,509
Incorrectly filled: 30%
