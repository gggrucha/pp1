24.	The educational course finished with a test checking the participants' knowledge. 
Here are the results obtained by the students:
[37,51,44,23,78,92,39,84,83,51]
Write a program that calculates and displays student scores that are equal to or greater than the following minimum number of points 
to pass the course:
a.	70
b.	40
c.	30
Use the filter() function and the following higher order function:
def min_pts(limit):
    return lambda pts: pts>=limit
Sample result:
Min 70 pts: [78, 92, 84, 83]
Min 40 pts: [51, 44, 78, 92, 84, 83, 51]
Min 30 pts: [37, 51, 44, 78, 92, 39, 84, 83, 51]
